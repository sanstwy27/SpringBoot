Removal of mapping types
Indices created in Elasticsearch 6.0.0 or later may only contain a single mapping type.
Indices created in 5.x with multiple mapping types will continue to function as before in Elasticsearch 6.x.
Types will be deprecated in APIs in Elasticsearch 7.0.0, and completely removed in 8.0.0.
